## Domain Description

HealthLine Solutions is an application that allows patients, doctors and admins to track hospital and community data from a single platform.
It allows patients to search and locate doctors based on hospitals in their community.
The doctors can diagnose vital signs of new or existing patients and tract their health progress by creating encounters.
The community admins can modify or update data belonging to their community. The system admins have access to all data

## Discplaimer

We have taken the following assumptions:

1. The community admins can only perform CRUD actions to data in their community (hospitals, hospitals list, doctors, doctors list)
2. The System admins can perform CRUD actions on all the data in the application (including encounter data).
